# Pixel-Canon Specification v1.0

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the formal specification for Pixel-Canon, a standard for describing the logical topology and orientation of dense, N-dimensional arrays representing image data. The goal is to provide an unambiguous, declarative, and cross-language-compatible way to describe how image data is structured in memory.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Declarative:** The user *describes* the layout, they do not write code to parse it.
*   **Explicit over Implicit:** All aspects of the layout are defined explicitly to eliminate guesswork.
*   **Focus on Logical Topology:** The specification describes how a developer *thinks* about the data (the logical layout), not necessarily the bit-for-bit physical storage (e.g., compressed or tiled formats, which are out of scope).
*   **Interoperability:** The specification is designed to be easily implemented in any programming language and serialized to common formats like JSON.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1. `ImageAxis` (Enum)

Represents a named, logical axis of the image data.

*   `HEIGHT`: The vertical axis.
*   `WIDTH`: The horizontal axis.
*   `CHANNELS`: The axis containing color or data channels.
*   `DEPTH`: The depth axis, for 3D volumetric images.
*   *Implementations may be extended with other axes like `TIME` or `BATCH`.*

### 3.2. `AxisDirection` (Enum)

Represents the semantic direction of a spatial axis, defining the location of the origin (0) and the direction of increasing coordinate values.

*   `DOWN`: For `HEIGHT` axis. Origin is at the top, values increase downwards. (Typical for computer vision).
*   `UP`: For `HEIGHT` axis. Origin is at the bottom, values increase upwards. (Typical for graphics APIs like OpenGL).
*   `RIGHT`: For `WIDTH` axis. Origin is at the left, values increase to the right.
*   `LEFT`: For `WIDTH` axis. Origin is at the right, values increase to the left.
*   `FORWARD`: For `DEPTH` axis. Origin is at the front, values increase "away" from the viewer.
*   `BACKWARD`: For `DEPTH` axis. Origin is at the back, values increase "towards" the viewer.
*   `SYMMETRIC`: Indicates that the axis is symmetrical, and an orientation/flip operation is meaningless.

### 3.3. `ChannelFormat` (String or Enum)

Represents the semantic meaning and order of the channels along the `CHANNELS` axis.

*   **Assumption:** This specification applies to layouts where each channel is a separate element in the array, not to packed-pixel formats (e.g., R5G6B5).
*   **Examples:** `"RGB"`, `"RGBA"`, `"BGR"`, `"BGRA"`, `"LUMINANCE"` (for single-channel images).

### 3.4. `MemoryOrder` (Enum)

Defines how the logical axes are mapped to linear memory. This determines which axis is the "fastest" (i.e., its elements are contiguous in memory).

*   `ROW_MAJOR` (C-style): The **last** axis in `axis_order` is the fastest.
*   `COLUMN_MAJOR` (Fortran-style): The **first** axis in `axis_order` is the fastest.

### 3.5. `ImageLayout` (Structure / Class)

The central, composite object that fully describes the layout.

*   `axis_order: Tuple[ImageAxis]`
    *   An ordered tuple defining the logical order of axes. Example: `(HEIGHT, WIDTH, CHANNELS)`.
*   `memory_order: MemoryOrder`
    *   The memory order used to interpret `axis_order`.
*   `directions: Dict[ImageAxis, AxisDirection]`
    *   A map specifying the direction for each spatial axis. Example: `{HEIGHT: DOWN, WIDTH: RIGHT}`.
*   `channels: ChannelFormat`
    *   The channel format description.

## 4. Scope

### In Scope

*   Description of dense, contiguous, N-dimensional arrays.
*   Logical topology (the order and relationship of axes).
*   Logical orientation (the direction of axes).

### Out of Scope

*   **Pixel Data Type:** The type of data (e.g., `uint8`, `float32`) is considered orthogonal and is handled by the native type system of the target language/library (e.g., `numpy.dtype`).
*   **Color Space:** The color space (e.g., `sRGB`, `Linear`) is considered a separate, semantic property of the pixel data, not its topological layout.
*   **Complex Physical Storage:** Packed-pixel formats, compressed formats (JPEG, BCn), planar formats (YUV420p), or tiled/swizzled memory layouts are not described by this specification.
